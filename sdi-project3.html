<p>I have continued with this theme so far throughout the term so now I would like to get into a little more detail.</p>
<p>I took one aspect of my story where I need to visit all of my clients in the order of the amounts of missed calls I received from them.  The code I will write will automatically figure out by the amount of missed calls who I should visit first.  The code will also give me their phone numbers and the type of system I the client has.</p>
